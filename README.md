# ![QAM Classifier](https://github.com/mryan6/IntroToAIFinalProject)
* Utilized MatLab Machine Learning and Deep Learning toolboxes to classify
spectrogram images of wireless signals
* Goal of this process was to learn which ML algorithm was best for this application, as well as tuning the different parameters for the chosen algorithm to achieve best results
* Trained Support Vector Machine classifier to 99% accuracy
* Utilized transfer learning using Googleâ€™s AlexNet to train a CNN classifier to 99%
accuracy
