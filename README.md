# [Sublime Data Analysis](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wE6PwQWb-wkR0DnQGO8Cj6FtwUuDU4pArvz0Keo1P20/edit?usp=sharing)
* Performed data analysis of Lime Scooters and their use throughout the city of
Hoboken
* Using Knime and Excel, a dataset consisting of hundreds of thousands of datapoints was cleaned and processed to better understand the maintenance and
usage of Lime Scooters
* Heatmap was created in order to tell users which areas are more likely to have
available scooters at different points in the day/week
* K-means clustering algorithm was used to determine at which areas scooters
were utilized most heavily
* Clusters also gave partial insight to Lime’s maintenance methods

# [QAM Classifier](https://github.com/mryan6/IntroToAIFinalProject)
* Utilized MatLab Machine Learning and Deep Learning toolboxes to classify
spectrogram images of wireless signals
* Goal of this process was to learn which ML algorithm was best for this application, as well as tuning the different parameters for the chosen algorithm to achieve best results
* Trained Support Vector Machine classifier to 99% accuracy
* Utilized transfer learning using Google’s AlexNet to train a CNN classifier to 99%
accuracy
